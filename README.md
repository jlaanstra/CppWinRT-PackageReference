# CppWinRT-PackageReference
This repository shows how to use NuGet PackageReferences with a C++WinRT project based on the general pupose PackageReference support provided by the project system per https://github.com/dotnet/project-system/issues/2491. Note that this is not officially supported and no guarantees are made that this will continue to work.
